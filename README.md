Display your own pre-set AI question list under each post, open answers in a new tab, and let OpenAI generate contextual replies automatically. Simple, secure, and fast.

== Description ==

**Moelog AI Q&A Links** is a lightweight plugin that allows authors to predefine questions for each post.  
At the bottom of each article, readers can click a question to open a new page where an AI (powered by OpenAI API) generates a contextual answer.

- üß† Supports OpenAI models (e.g., `gpt-4o-mini`, `gpt-4-turbo`, etc.)
- üóùÔ∏è Secure API key management (supports `wp-config.php` constant)
- üß© Works with both posts and pages
- üåè Multilingual support (auto-detects Chinese / Japanese / English)
- ‚ö° Built-in caching and rate limiting
- üß± Safe HTML rendering (no XSS risk)
- üîê Triple-layer protection (Nonce + Timestamp + HMAC)
- ‚å®Ô∏è Typewriter effect on the answer page (progressively reveals sanitized AI output)
- ü§ñ User-Agent bot blocking to avoid unwanted crawler-triggered API calls
- üìù **New in 1.2.0: Customizable question list heading (`<h3>`) via Settings**
- üìú **New in 1.2.0: Customizable disclaimer on the answer page (supports `{site}` placeholder; `%s` backward-compatible)**

Built with strict WordPress coding standards and complete security in mind ‚Äî  
ready for production and WordPress.org submission.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `moelog-ai-qna-links` to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or install directly via the WordPress Plugin Directory.
2. Activate the plugin through **Plugins ‚Üí Installed Plugins**.
3. Go to **Settings ‚Üí Moelog AI Q&A** and enter your OpenAI API Key and model name.
4. When editing a post, scroll down to **AI ÂïèÈ°åÊ∏ÖÂñÆ (AI Question List)** and add your questions (one per line).
5. Save and view your post ‚Äî questions will appear below your article.

Optional:
- Add `define('MOELOG_AIQNA_API_KEY', 'sk-xxxxxx');` in `wp-config.php` for higher security.
- Use `[moelog_aiqna]` shortcode to manually insert question list anywhere.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does it require an OpenAI API key? =
Yes. You can create one at https://platform.openai.com/.  
The plugin allows entering it in Settings, or securely defining it in `wp-config.php`.

= Is it safe to expose AI answers to visitors? =
Yes. All outputs are strictly sanitized using `wp_kses()` with a minimal whitelist to avoid XSS.
Links and potentially risky tags/attributes are removed.

= Can I include the post content as context? =
Yes. There is an option **‚ÄúInclude post content to AI‚Äù** in Settings.  
It sends a truncated (default 6000 characters) plain-text version of the article to improve contextual accuracy.

= How does rate limiting work? =
Each visitor‚Äôs IP is limited to 10 requests per hour, and each unique question has a 60-second cooldown.  
Cached answers are reused to save your OpenAI API quota.

= Will search engine crawlers trigger API calls? =
The answer page is marked `noindex,nofollow`, and we block common bots via User-Agent on the answer route.  
Additionally, requests must pass nonce/timestamp/HMAC checks; invalid/expired links are rejected before any API call.

= Can I change the typewriter speed? =
Yes. The speed defaults to 18ms per character. You can adjust the inline JS constant (`SPEED = 18`) on the answer page template.

= Can I customize the question list heading? =
Yes. From **1.2.0**, go to **Settings ‚Üí Moelog AI Q&A ‚Üí Question List Heading** and enter your text (any language).
Developers may also override via the `moelog_aiqna_list_heading` filter.

= Can I customize the disclaimer text on the answer page? =
Yes. From **1.2.0**, go to **Settings ‚Üí Moelog AI Q&A ‚Üí Disclaimer** and edit the text.  
It supports the `{site}` placeholder (replaced with your site name) and is backward-compatible with `%s`.  
Developers may also filter the final text via `moelog_aiqna_disclaimer_text`.

= How do I completely remove all data? =
When you uninstall the plugin, all related options, postmeta, and cached transients are automatically deleted.
